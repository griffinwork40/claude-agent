## How to Prioritize Solutions

### Start with these criteria:
- **Impact**: How many people would benefit significantly?
- **Feasibility**: Can the agent provide meaningful assistance with current capabilities?
- **ROI**: How much time/money would the solution save compared to its development cost?
- **Domain expertise**: Is there sufficient information available to train or prompt the agent effectively?

### For initial development:
Focus on problems where Claude can augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely, especially where:
- The task is repetitive
- There are established patterns that can be learned
- The volume of work is high
- Current solutions are time-consuming or inconsistent
