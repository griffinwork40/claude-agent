## Logo Concept

The Enlist logo features a bold, geometric **E** integrated with three checkmark indicators. This design represents:

- **Automation**: The E symbolizes "Enlist" while the integrated checkmarks represent automated task completion
- **Progress**: Three distinct stages aligned with the horizontal bars of the E, mirroring the job search workflow (search → curate → apply)
- **Efficiency**: Clean, professional design reflecting the time-saving nature of the platform
- **Control**: Checkmarks symbolize human approval and oversight in the automation process

## Color Palette

- **Primary Dark**: `#0F172A` (Slate 900) - Professional, trustworthy
- **Accent Blue**: `#3B82F6` to `#2563EB` (Blue 500-600 gradient) - Modern, tech-forward
- **Light**: `#F8FAFC` (Slate 50) - Clean, approachable

## Files

## Usage Guidelines

- Use monogram for square/compact spaces (social media, app icons)

- Ensure sufficient contrast with backgrounds

## Timeless Design Principles

The logo is designed to remain relevant by:
- Using geometric shapes rather than trendy effects
- Employing a minimal color palette
- Avoiding temporal design fads
- Focusing on core brand values: efficiency, automation, trust
